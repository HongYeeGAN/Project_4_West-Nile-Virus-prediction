    "\n",
    "#### Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate aim of this project is to have a prediction model that can provide knowledge on where and when different species of mosquitos will test positive for West Nile virus. This is to determine a cost effective plan to deploy pesticides spraying locations as pesticide is expensive and have adverse effects on human. Hence pesticides should be use with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "**How is the solution supposed to be used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are a group of data scientist who works at the Disease And Treatment Agency, division of Societal Cures In Epidemiology and New Creative Engineering (DATA-SCIENCE). Recent West Nile virus outbreak from mosquito, has been the most commonly spread virus to human. Around 20% of the people who become infected with the virus developed symptoms ranging from a persistent fever, to serious neurological illnesses that can result in death. As changing climate allows mosquito population to increase, these control efforts will become more difficult. This risk is why the Chicago Department for Public Health (CDPH) established a surveillance and control program in 2004. Every week from late spring through the fall, mosquitos in traps across the city are tested for the virus. The results of these tests is used to generate WNV predictions based on the appropriate classifier model we built. This way, we can predict the information of when and where different species of mosquitos will test positive for West Nile virus and detect at-risk sites earlier. We can now spray sooner, reducing public exposure to the virus. The prediction enables the city to spray areas that was predicted to be WNV positive, for two weeks(life cycle of mosquito is 8 to 10 days) in a row, effectively reducing the impact of virus. In addition, we can also reduce large scale of pesticides used to spray around in the city of Chicago by spraying only at model predicted WNV positive areas. Pesticides not only expensive, it also pose health concerns to humans if overexposed. As such, we need to control pesticide usage by deploying a cost effective spray plan using our classifier model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Top predictors identified by our Xgboost classifier is:\\\n",
    "1) Species - Culex Pipens/Restuans\\\n",
    "2) During July and August during Summer whereby temperature is high and humid.\\\n",
    "3) At trap locations T900, T035, T009, T002, T011, T073, T082, T223, T008, T054\n",
    "\n",
    "**How will the solution be integrated into the organization?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this week’s CDPH mosquito traps results, we can use it to generate predictions based on our model, to find out whether there will be WNV positive at a location. Building an algorithm that can detect at-risk sites earlier means that we can spray sooner, reducing public exposure to the virus. The prediction enables the city of Chicago to spray areas that was predicted to be WNV positive, for two weeks in a row, effectively reducing the impact of virus. This is a great effort from Chicago’s Data Science team.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who from the organization will perform this deployment?**\n",
    "\n",
    "CDPH members, CDC members who are biostatisticians and epidemiologists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who is going to use this solution to make a difference?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision-makers, focusing almost exclusively on cost-benefit analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How will the success of the solution be measured?**\n",
    "\n",
    "From a data science perspective, the success metric is the ROC AUC score. From the social perspective, success metric is the reduction of West nile virus infected count. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "- The general public, Chicago City\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Science Problem\n",
    "# This is a binary classification problem which predicts whether different species of mosquitos will be tested positive for West Nile virus, based on where and where they were captured\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "We are a group of data scientist who works at the Disease And Treatment Agency, division of Societal Cures In Epidemiology and New Creative Engineering (DATA-SCIENCE). Chicago Department for Public Health (CDPH) established a surveillance and control program in 2004 to combat outbreak of West Nile Virus and thus every week from late spring through the fall, mosquitos in traps across the city are tested for the virus. Through the use of mosquito results as train dataset, we studied the relationship between positive West nile virus(WNV) and various conditions/variables for their impact on WNV test results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of these tests is then used to generate WNV predictions based on appropriate model(XGboost classifier) we build. Prediction is on when, where various mosquito species will be tested positive. Finally, we studied and interpreted the XGboost classifier model that we used in the context of how certain features predicts positive mosquito test results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial exploratory data analysis showed that:\n",
    "Findings from Exploratory Data Analysis:\n",
    "- Increase in number of mosquitos in July and August, due to rising temperature, humidity and with later sunrise.\n",
    "- Fogging in general helps to control the population of the mosquitos, especially in 2013.\n",
    "- The majority of the species carrying the virus are Culex Pipiens and Culex Restuans, they also tend to be the dominant population.\n",
    "\n",
    "After evaluating all the models, the final optimized model is the XGboost classifier, with the following parameters:\n",
    "- eval_metric='auc'\n",
    "- subsample = 1\n",
    "- colsample_bytree = .15\n",
    "- learning_rate = .05\n",
    "- max_depth=3\n",
    "- scale_pos_weight=19\n",
    "- n_estimators=500\n",
    "- reg_alpha=.9\n",
    "- reg_lambda= 5\n",
    "- gamma=0.01\n",
    "\n",
    "After studying the coefficients of our variables/features after XGBoost Classifier, it appears the below factors are able help us identify the species, locations an when mosquito will be tested positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where?**\n",
    "Based on the model prediction, the areas that requires highest attention are location around traps T900, T002, T008 and T225 as these are areas with the highest chance of an outbreak with large population of mosquitos. The secondary areas are traps with which the model predicts to have high probabilities of an outbreak. They are location around traps T009, T035, T009, T011, T073, T223, T082, T054, T102, T080, T235, T077, T226, T237, T156 and T076.\n",
    "This is illustrated in the map below.\n",
    "<img src=\"../assets/top_spray_clusters.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Species?**\n",
    "The model also determined that the type of species determines how likely the mosquitoes are infected with WNV. Out of the top 7 determinants, 3 of them relates to the mosquitoes' species. Specifically, the most infectious species are **Culex Pipiens and Culex Restauns**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When?**\n",
    "Based on our model, weather condition also has a direct correlation to the number of mosquitos and the presence of WNV. This is consistent with our EDA. Based on weather pattern which was also considered in our model, there is a peak during the months of **July and August**. This is also because it is summer period where conditions hot and humid, are very ideal for breeding. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Areas for expansion and future exploration:**\n",
    "- Moving forward, the model can be continuously improved by introducing more new data to it. As this data is a highly imbalance one, ROC AUC and other metrics can be improved if more WNV positive information were introduced. Hence better predictions for us Data Scientist and stakeholders such as City of Chicago and CDPH.\n",
    "- We recommend to take into consideration the inhabitants population density of the areas into the dataset in order to asses the importance of eradicating the mosquitos. This could provide important clues about the right choice of spraying and WNV detection rate.\n",
    "- Since our ROC AUC for the viable classification model is 0.69 based on Kaggle results. Since value is not great, we can adjust the spray plan accordingly to compensate for the weaker prediction.\n",
    "- Data from other mosquito-borne illness such as more threatening Zika virus or Aedes aegypti can also be added to expand the model to not limited just to West Nile virus use. The model can be applied to more mosquito types, eventually making classification predictions for the entire mosquito illness in the future.\n",
    "- Lastly West Nile virus activity is also abserved high in Sacramento, Califronia. This model can be applied if surveillance and control program is implemented in Sacramento county and results of virus test on mosquitos collected is used to train the model algorithum for Sacramento Califronia prediction.\n",
    "- Since 2 species (Culex Pipiens, Culex Pipiens/Restuans) stand out as a carrier with higher rates of WNV, We suggest to increase efforts in preventing the proliferation of this specie in particular. This could be done with more specific and environmentally friendly measures (e.g. “targeted biological mosquito control”) which would make the process of lowering occurrences more efficient and less costly\n",
    "- We propose to invest efforts in prevention, starting from increasing awareness of the general population to not leave exposed untreated water (e.g. ponds and pools in their yard)."
